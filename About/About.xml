Vanilla Weapons Expanded is part of a series of mods expanding on everyday life on the Rimworld. When paired together with a brand new Vanilla Apparel Expanded and Vanilla Armours Expanded, you can bring something to your game that will keep you interested in it for days.

Weapons are spread across the technology tree allowing for realistic and time-consuming progression, making the higher-tech weapons even more rewarding. Bear in mind, however, that all weapons are perfectly balanced in line with Vanilla weapons, which means that a Battle Rifle added by this mod might not necessarily be better than a standard assault rifle in some situations.
